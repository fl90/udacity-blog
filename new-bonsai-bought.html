                    </div>
                    Today i decided to buy raw material from an ordinary garden center and try to make a bonsai out of it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So i hopped in my car and drove to the nearest hardware store. In germany they usually have an area for plants and flowers in there.
                    I wandered throught their evergreens and deciduous trees and found an hinoki cypress. Luckily there were 20% off of
                    every plant that day. 
                    <div class="content-image-container">
                        <img class="content-image" src="img/bonsai2.jpg" alt="this is what i ended up with">
                        <div class="content-image-caption">caption: this is what i ended up with</div>
                    </div>
                    <h2>What to do to make this a beautiful bonsai?</h2>
                    Back home i removed the small branches that are growing directly out of the main trunk. A beautiful bonsai shows the trunk. 
                    Otherwise its only a bush. 
                    <br><br>
                    After removing the small branches i could see the trunk and decided which thicker branches i wanna keep. The decision was made
                    and i removed the branches that i donÂ´t need anymore.
                    I also removed small green branches that start right were the thicker branches grew out of the main trunk.
                    <br><br>
                    Now we have to wire the branches. Best way to do this is to wire always two branches together. Wrap the wire at a 45 degree angle around
                    the branch, starting at the main trunk.
                    <h2>How do you show more of the trunk?</h2>
                    Raw material is usually planted very deep in the pot. Removed the plant from the pot and scratch away the top of the soil.
                    Maybe you'll find a larger trunk or beautiful looking surface roots.
                    <br><br>
                    Repot the bonsai in proper pot and this could be the your result.
